# Introduction
Welcome to my Developing Maintenance Software coursework project. I am Seow Weng Yann (Student ID: 20618809), and this project focuses on creating an implementation of the classic game **1942**.

For the best experience, it is recommended to view this `README.md` file on the [GitHub website](https://github.com/swyannnn/CW2024). Navigation links have been embedded throughout the document to facilitate easy access to different sections.

## Project Goals

- **User-Friendly Design:** Develop an intuitive and hassle-free gaming experience that is easy to understand and enjoyable to play.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Focus on improving the overall user interaction and engagement with the game.
- **Maintainable Codebase:** Refactor the existing code to ensure it is clean, well-organized, and prepared for future expansions and enhancements.

# Compilation Instructions

# Implemented and Working Properly

This section details the features that have been successfully implemented in both the frontend and backend of the project. Each feature is explained by outlining the <b>original version</b>, the <b>shortcomings of that approach</b>, the <b>new implementation</b>, and the <b>reasons why the modifications enhance the overall project</b>.

## Frontend

**Main Menu**
<style>
table, th, td {
  border:1px solid black;
}
</style>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement/Modification</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Main menu page doesn't exist
    </td>
    <td>
    No centralized hub for accessing different game functionalities, leading to a disorganized entry point.
    </td>
    <td>
    A comprehensive main menu has been developed, offering players options to start the game or select other functionalities.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Double Player Option**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Only single-player mode
    </td>
    <td>
    Limiting the game to single player mode restricted the potential audience and replayability. Catering to different player preferences increases the game's appeal and accommodates both solo and group gaming sessions.
    </td>
    <td>
    Players can now choose between single player or double player modes before starting the game, allowing for a tailored experience based on player preferences.
    </td>
  </tr>

**Game Instruction**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    No instructions provided
    </td>
    <td>
    Players are unaware of game objectives and controls, leading to a confusion and frustration. Offering clear instructions helps players understand game mechanics and objectives, enhancing overall gameplay experience.
    </td>
    <td>
    Instructions are now easily visible on game screen, ensuring they know what to expect when gameplay begins.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Scrolling Backgrounds**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Static background
    </td>
    <td>
    Static backgrounds can make the game feel monotonous and less immersive.ias. Improving visual appeal and immersion is necessary to keep players engaged and provides a more enjoyable and lively gaming environment.
    </td>
    <td>
    A visually appealing scrolling background has been implemented.
    </td>
  </tr>

**Automated Fire Projectile without Key Press**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Players are required to press the spacebar to fire projectiles
    </td>
    <td>
    Requiring repetitive key presses could be cumbersome during intense gameplay. Reducing the need for repetitive key presses allows players to focus more on movement, evasion, and strategy rather than repeatedly pressing a key.
    </td>
    <td> 
    The fire mechanism has been automated to ensure continuous firing without extra input.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Player(s) Horizontal Movement**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Players are only allowed to move vertically
    </td>
    <td> 
    Restricting movement to one axis limits gameplay complexity and player control. Ensuring responsive controls enhances gameplay fluidity and player satisfaction by providing seamless interaction with the game environment.
    </td>
    <td>
    The player characters can now move smoothly and intuitively along the horizontal axis.
    </td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Pausing option doesn't exist
    </td>
    <td>
    Inability to pause can disrupt the gaming experience, especially during unforeseen interruptions. Allowing players to pause the game allow players with more control over their gaming experience and the flexibility.
    </td>
    <td>

    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Lack of audio and sound effects.
    </td>
    <td> 
    Absence of audio can make the game feel less immersive and fail to provide essential feedback to player actions.      Incorporating audio enhances the game's atmosphere and immersion, making the gameplay more engaging and enjoyable for players.
