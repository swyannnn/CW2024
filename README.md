    Switched to <code>AnimationTimer</code>, which provides a continuous game loop that updates based on system time. All these logics are handled by <a href="src/main/java/com/example/demo/manager/GameLoopManager.java">GameLoopManager</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **2. Remove Out-of-Bound Actors**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>

    <td>      
    - Allowing out-of-bound actors to persist unnecessarily increases memory usage and computational overhead.<br>
    - Removing them improves game performance and ensures efficient resource utilization. <br>
    - It also prevents potential logic errors involving out-of-bound actors.
    </td>
    <td>
    Introduced logic to remove actors once they move outside the visible screen area.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **3. Reduce actor bounding box for less sensitive collision detection**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Collision detection used the full bounding box of actors, which often resulted in overly sensitive collision responses.
    </td>
    <td>      
      - Using the full bounding box for collision detection does not account for the actual shape or movement of actors, leading to false-positive collisions. <br>
      - Reducing the bounding box size allows for more accurate and fair collision detection.
    </td>
    <td>
      Reduced the collision bounding box size by applying a shrink factor to actor dimensions.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **4. Centralized State Management**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Each level (e.g., LevelOne, LevelTwo) independently managed its logic, including level transitions, enemy spawning, and UI initialization. 
    </td>
    <td>      
      - Duplicated logic across levels made it challenging to scale or modify game behavior consistently. <br>
      - A centralized system simplifies transitions, improves code reusability, and enables scalable design.
    </td>
    <td>
      A `StateManager` class was introduced, leveraging the <strong>State Pattern</strong> to centralize transitions and lifecycle management. More information please kindly visit <a href="#comexampledemostate">this section</a>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **5. Improved Actor and Level Creation with Factory Pattern**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Actors and levels were created manually in each class with hardcoded configurations.
    </td>
    <td>
      - Hardcoding actor and level creation increased redundancy and reduced scalability.<br>
      - Introducing a centralized factory allows dynamic creation of actors and levels with consistent configurations, enabling easy customization and future extensibility.
    </td>
    <td>
      - Leveraged the <strong>Factory Pattern</strong> to create actors and levels dynamically. <br>
      - See <a href="src/main/java/com/example/demo/actor/plane/PlaneFactory.java">PlaneFactory</a>, <a href="src/main/java/com/example/demo/actor/projectile/ProjectileFactory.java">ProjectileFactory</a> and <a href="src/main/java/com/example/demo/level/LevelFactory.java">LevelFactory</a> for more details.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### **6. Flexible Behavior Management with Strategy Pattern**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Movement and firing behaviors were hardcoded directly into specific actor classes.
    </td>
    <td>
      - Hardcoding behaviors tightly couples logic with the actor classes, reducing flexibility.<br>
      - The Strategy Pattern enables dynamic assignment and modification of behaviors at runtime, making it easier to implement diverse movement and firing styles.
    </td>
    <td>
      Leveraged the <strong>Strategy Pattern</strong> to decouple behaviors from actor classes:
      <ul>
        - <a href="#comexampledemostrategymovement">MovementStrategy</a>:  Each actor can dynamically switch between movement styles.<br>
        - <a href="#comexampledemostrategyfiring">FiringStrategy</a>:  Flexible firing patterns are assigned to actors at runtime.
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


### **7. Efficient Resource Management with Cleanup Process**
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Original Version</th>
    <th>Reason for Improvement</th>
    <th>New Implementation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      No explicit cleanup process was implemented when switching game states or exiting the game.
    </td>
    <td>      
      - Failing to release resources when switching states or quitting the game may result in memory leaks and degraded performance.<br>
      - A robust cleanup process ensures proper resource deallocation, improves game stability, and prevents memory leaks.
    </td>
    <td>
      Introduced a comprehensive <code>cleanup()</code> process to ensure efficient resource management. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
